 * A class representing the queue of asynchronously executing tasks.

 * single task queue the tasks from which are executed by the pool of threads
 * managed by the system.
 *
 * Depending on the construction parameter, the runner object may execute the
 * tasks sequentially in the FIFO order, or can attempt to execute the tasks
 * as concurrently as possible. In the latter case the sequence of task
 * completions is not defined as tasks may or may not be run concurrently by
 * several threads.
 *
 * The runner is capable of accepting any C++ Callable object as a task, and
 * will create a cool::basis::aim object as a mechanism for the task submitter
 * to either be notified about, or to collect the result of each task.
 *
 * @note The runner objects normally represent independent task queues. However,
 *   the runner objects created using copy construction or copy assignment
 *   operator are considered clones and represent the same task queue.
 *
 * <b>Thread Safety</b><br>
 * Although the main use model is not multi-thread scenario, the runner objects
 * are thread safe.
 *
 * <b>Platform Availability</b><br>
 * This class is available on Mac OS/X, Linux and Microsoft Windows, with the
 * following exceptions:
 *  - queue priority <tt>DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_BACKGROUND</tt> is not available

/**
 * A class representing the task, or a sequence of tasks, to be synchronously
 * executed in one or more task queues.
 *
 * The task interface represents an alternative to the runner::run() method which
 * is more suitable for the asynchronous processing model. While both models
 * provide the means for sequential execution of tasks and transferring the
 * results (return values) of preceding task to the next task, the task
 * interface provides the following advantages over the runner::run() method:
 *
 * - the runner::run() produced a pair of @ref cool::basis::aim "aim"/@ref cool::basis::vow "vow"
 *   objects for each tun task. In addition, sequencing the tasks via one of
 *   @ref cool::basis::aim::then() "aim::then()" methods produced another pair for each task
 *   added to the sequence. And since these objects were primarily designed to
 *   support multi-threading model, each such pair shares a shared state guarded
 *   by std::mutex, which unnecessarily slows down the asynchronous processing.
 * - the @ref cool::basis::aim "aim" offered no guaranties about which
 *   @ref cool::gcd::task::runner "runner" will execute the tasks supplied via
 *   @ref cool::basis::aim::then() "aim::then()" method. Depending on
 *   the availability of the results it could have been the runner executing the
 *   first task, or the runner calling runner::run method. The task interface
 *   not only guarantees which runner will execute the next task in the
 *   sequence but also allows the user code to select a different runner than
 *   the default.
 *
 * The task objects are not copyable but are movable. They cannot be constructed
 * directly but are created either by @ref cool::gcd::task::factory "task factory"
 * or by one of the task::then() method templates.
 *
 * @exception cool::gcd::task::runner_not_available thrown when the tasks are
 *   to be submitted for execution to their respective
 *   @ref cool::gcd::task::runner "runner" task queues, but the destination runner
 *   no longer exists. In this case, the task library will throw this exception,
 *   which will be passed to the error handler provided through one of the
 *   @ref task::then() "then()" methods. Note however, that if the error handler
 *   was to be run on the same runner that is no longer available, the error
 *   handler will not be scheduled to run and this exception will disappear
 *   unnoticed. This exception is thrown during the task sequence execution and is
 *   asynchronous with regard to the code that constructed and manipulated the
 *   task object(s).
 *
 * @exception cool::exception::illegal_state thrown immediately by task methods
 *   if the task object on which the method was tried is no longer valid. This
 *   exception is synchronous with regard to the caller of the method.
 *
 *
 * <b>Portability and Limitations</b><br>
 * The task interface is available on Max OS/X using Xcode 7 or later,
 * Linux using gcc 5.0 or later, and Microsoft Windows using
 * Visual Studio 2013 or later.
 *
 * The following are limitations applicable to Microsoft Windows:
 *
 * 1. when using Visual Studio 2013:
 *   - user Callable objects may not accept parameters, except for error
 *     handlers which must be of @ref error_handler_t compatible type,
 *     and the mandatory first parameter if preceding task returns value.
 *
 * 2. when using Visual Studio 2015:
 *   - user Callable objects may not accept parameters, except for error
 *     handlers which must be of @ref error_handler_t compatible type,
 *     and the mandatory first parameter if preceding task returns value.

   *
   * @note This method invalidates the current (@c this) object, and returns

   *    If the return value type of this task is non-void, the Callable's first
   *    argument must be @c const @c ResultT&, where ResultT is the type of the
   *    return value of this task's Callable.
   * @tparam Args... the template parameter pack of additional arguments passed to
   *    the user supplied Callable, after the optional first argument.
   *
   * The method must be provided with the following parameters:
   * @param runner_ the @ref cool::gcd::task::runner "runner" to run the @c func_ Callable.
   * @param func_ the user supplied Callable to be scheduled for execution upon
   *    the successful completion of this task.
   * @param args_ additional arguments to be passed to the user provided
   *    Callable when it begins the execution. Note that the additional arguments
   *    are passed after the first argument, if the current task's return value
   *    is non-void, or as the first, second, etc. argument if it is void.
   *
   * @return a new task object, which is to be used from this point on instead
   *    of the current task object.
   *
   * If the current task throws an exception during its execution, the task
   * library will schedule the first error handler that follows the current task.
   * Error handlers are specified as parameters in @ref then(), @ref on_exception() and
   * @ref on_any_exception() methods. If the current task throws an exception then
   * the user provided Callable @c func_  will not be scheduled.
   *
   * If the current task does not
   * throw an exception, the task library will schedule @c func_ for execution,
   * optionally passing it a return value of the current task (if non-void).
   * @c func_ will be scheduled to run on the same @ref cool::gcd::task::runner "runner"
